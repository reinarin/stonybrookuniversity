### AMS 303 Graph Theory

**Instructor Information:**

- Alan Tucker

#### Course Description

Paths and circuits, trees and tree based algorithms, graph coloring, digraphs, network flows, matching theory, matroids, and games with graphs.

#### Learning Outcomes
<ol>
  <li>Develop skill with proofs in graph theory (this is the only Applied Math course that teaches proofs), including:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>the careful use of definitions and stated conditions, and their consequences;</li>
      <li>direct arguments;</li>
      <li>indirect arguments, i.e., proof by contradiction;</li>
      <li>proof with generalized figures.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Examine graph theory topics in greater depth (than AMS 301) with a focus on studying and extending theoretical results:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>general graph properties;</li>
      <li>planar graphs;</li>
      <li>graph coloring, including edge and face coloring.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Understand the theory behind Polya's Enumeration Formula and use this understanding in applied problem-solving.</li>
  <li>Develop the network algorithms for:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>maximal minimal flows;</li>
      <li>maximal matching; </li>
      <li>the transportation problem.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Understand the set-theoretic constructions underlying the theory of progressively finite games and apply this knowledge to develop winning strategies for such games:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>kernel of a game;</li>
      <li>level-by-level construction;</li>
      <li>Grundy functions;</li>
      <li>direct sums of games, including Nim.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Use combinatorial reasoning to efficiently solve cryptograms based on keyword transpose encodings; extend this reasoning to solve polyalphabetic codes.</li>
  </ol>
