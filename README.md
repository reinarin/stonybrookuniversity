### Requirements for the Major

- **Required courses in Applied Math and Statistics**
  - **MAT 203 Calculus III with Applications**
    - Vector algebra in two and three dimensions, multivariate differential and integral calculus, optimization, vector calculus including the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. Applications to economics, engineering, and all sciences, with emphasis on numerical and graphical solutions; use of graphing calculators or computers. 

- **Electives**
  - **AMS 301 Finite Mathematicals Structures**
    - An introduction to graph theory and combinatorial analysis. The emphasis is on solving applied problems rather than on theorems and proofs. Techniques used in problem solving include generating functions, recurrence relations, and network flows. This course develops the type of mathematical thinking that is fundamental to computer science and operations research.
  - **AMS 310 Survey of Probability and Statistics**
    - A survey of data analysis, probability theory, and statistics. Stem and leaf displays, box plots, schematic plots, fitting straight line relationships, discrete and continuous probability distributions, conditional distributions, binomial distribution, normal and t distributions, confidence intervals, and significance tests.
  - **AMS 315 Data Analysis**
    - A continuation of AMS 310 that covers two sample t-tests, contingency table methods, the one-way analysis of variance, and regression analysis with one and multiple independent variables. Student projects analyze data provided by the instructor and require the use of a statistical computing package such as SAS or SPSS. An introduction to ethical and professional standards of conduct for statisticians will be provided.
  - **AMS 394 Statistical Laboratory**
    -  Designed for students interested in statistics and their applications. Basic statistical techniques including sampling, design, regression, and analysis of variance are introduced. Includes the use of statistical packages such as SAS and R. Students translate realistic research problems into a statistical context and perform the analysis.
  - **AMS 345 Computational Geometry**
    - The design and analysis of efficient algorithms to solve geometric problems that arise in computer graphics, robotics, geographical information systems, manufacturing, and optimization. Topics include convex hulls, triangulation, Voronoi diagrams, visibility, intersection, robot motion planning, and arrangements.
  - **MAT 331 Computer-Assisted Math Problem Solving**
    - Exploration of the use of the computer as a tool to gain insight into complex mathematical problems through a project-oriented approach. Students learn both the relevant mathematical concepts and ways that the computer can be used (and sometimes misused) to understand them. The particular problems may vary by semester; past topics have included cryptography, fractals and recursion, modeling the flight of a glider, curve fitting, the Brachistochrone, and computer graphics. No previous experience with computers is required.
  - **AMS 303 Graph Theory**
    - Paths and circuits, trees and tree based algorithms, graph coloring, digraphs, network flows, matching theory, matroids, and games with graphs.
  - **AMS 361 Applied Calculus IV: Differential Equations**
    - Homogeneous and inhomogeneous linear differential equations; systems of linear differential equations; solution with power series and Laplace transforms; partial differential equations and Fourier series.

- **Upper-Division Writing Requirement**
  - **AMS 300 Writing in Applied Mathematics**
    - All degree candidates must demonstrate skill in written English at a level acceptable for Applied Mathematics and Statistics majors. AMS students must register for the writing course AMS 300, or submit a technical paper(s) written for other courses. The requirement may also be met by earning a grade of C or higher in a writing course approved by the Department or, if the student has a double major, by satisfying the requirement for the other major.
