planning, drafting, and revising stages. Students will reinforce their communication skills by giving an
oral presentation on a mathematical topic with a focus on technical competence, communications
skills, professionalism, and the development of lifelong learning skills. Two additional reflection essays
will be used to guide students to plan, monitor, and assess their own understanding and performance.
